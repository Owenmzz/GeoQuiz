# Zero-Basis Android Native Development Learning
Hello everyone, I am Owen, a front-end developer. Recently, there was a demand for Android native development in my company, but the original Android developer left. In the spirit of challenging myself, I took over this project. I may not yet realize how intense the storm ahead will be, but I take this challenge very seriously.

Borrowing from an article I read today, https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public, it mentions that we should not only consume content but also create content. By making my learning process public, I hope it can help other beginners like me and I also look forward to receiving advice and engaging in more discussions with experienced people.

With my years of web front-end development experience, I believe I can overcome this!

Slowly boiling frogs will wear down passion and willpower, but facing new challenges every day will make one stronger!
